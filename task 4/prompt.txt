Analyze the following code snippet from three distinct expert perspectives. For each role, provide specific, actionable recommendations and observations:

1. **As an Experienced Senior Developer** - Focus on code quality, maintainability, best practices, TypeScript usage, and architectural decisions.

2. **As a Security Engineer** - Focus on security vulnerabilities, input validation, data sanitization, and potential attack vectors.

3. **As a Performance Specialist** - Focus on performance optimizations, memory usage, algorithmic efficiency, and scalability concerns.

For each perspective, provide concrete recommendations with code examples where applicable.

CODE TO ANALYZE:
function processUserData(data: any) {
  var users = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    var user = {
      id: data[i].id,
      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false,
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log('Processed ' + users.length + ' users');
  return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
  //TODO: Implement database connection
  var success = true;
  return success;
}
