    "analysis_reasoning": "This feedback is clearly about a specific product - a high-end gaming mouse ($150 price point). Let me analyze step by step: The user reports multiple technical issues (sensor tracking problems, dongle failure) and mentions specific technical details (8000hz polling rate), indicating they are experienced with gaming peripherals. The sentiment is negative due to product defects and poor reliability. The user had to return their first unit, showing significant problems with quality control.",
