# Advanced Database Selection with CoT Reasoning

Act as a senior database architect. Use systematic Chain-of-Thought reasoning to select the optimal database solution.

## Scenario:
You're designing the data layer for a new social media platform with the following specifications:

**Business Requirements:**
- Target: Millions of concurrent users
- Core Features: User profiles, content posts, social connections
- Performance: Read-optimized (80% reads, 20% writes)
- Scalability: Horizontal scaling capability essential

## Chain-of-Thought Framework:

### Phase 1: Requirement Decomposition
Break down each requirement and explain its technical implications:
- What does "millions of users" mean for data volume?
- How do social connections affect data relationships?
- What are the implications of read-heavy workloads?

### Phase 2: Database Category Analysis
For each database type, reason through:
- **Relational (SQL)**: Suitability analysis with pros/cons
- **Document (NoSQL)**: Fit assessment with justification
- **Graph Databases**: Relevance evaluation for social connections
- **Hybrid Solutions**: Multi-database approach consideration

### Phase 3: Performance & Scalability Reasoning
- Read optimization strategies for each database type
- Horizontal scaling capabilities analysis
- Write performance trade-offs evaluation

### Phase 4: Decision Matrix
Create a weighted evaluation showing:
- How each option scores against requirements
- Critical factors that eliminate certain options
- Why the chosen solution is optimal

### Phase 5: Implementation Justification
- Specific database recommendation
- Architecture patterns to employ
- Potential challenges and mitigation strategies
