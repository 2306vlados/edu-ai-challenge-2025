## Summary

The audio transcript is a medical consultation involving a 25-year-old patient presenting with sharp chest pain lasting about three days. The pain is localized over the heart area, sharp in nature, lasts a few seconds, and worsens with coughing or lying down but improves when leaning forward. The pain sometimes radiates to the neck. The patient denies other symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, weakness, numbness, fever, or viral symptoms currently, though they recently recovered from the flu.

The patient has no significant past medical history, no medications except occasional Tylenol, no allergies, and no surgeries. Family history is notable for the patient’s father having a fatal heart attack two weeks ago, which is causing the patient considerable anxiety about their own symptoms. The patient is a healthy non-smoker, occasional alcohol user, and denies recreational drug use. They are a student with a part-time job and live with their mother.

The clinician acknowledges the patient’s fears, expresses sympathy for the recent family loss, and plans to perform diagnostic tests including an ECG and possibly blood work to evaluate the heart function. The patient is advised not to worry excessively until test results are available. The consultation ends with reassurance and a plan for further assessment.
