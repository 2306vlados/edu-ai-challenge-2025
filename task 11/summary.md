## Summary

The patient, a healthy 25-year-old engineering student and part-time postman, presents with sharp chest pain over the heart area lasting a few seconds, starting three days ago. The pain worsens with coughing or lying down and improves when leaning forward. It occasionally radiates to the neck and rates 6/10 in intensity. There are no associated symptoms like shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or other systemic signs. The patient recently recovered from the flu but has no history of medical conditions, surgeries, or medication use besides occasional Tylenol. Notably, the patient's father died of a heart attack two weeks ago, raising concern about cardiac issues. The clinician plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate heart function, reassuring the patient to avoid excessive worry until results are available.
